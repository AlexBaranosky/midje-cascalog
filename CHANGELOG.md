## 1.3.2

* Added `produces` chatty checker to allow for more dynamic midje fact generation.

## 1.3.1

* Moved Cascalog from :dependencies to :dev-dependencies. To use midje-cascalog, you'll have to explicitly include cascalog in your own project. (this prevents version clashes between deps and dev-dependencies.)
